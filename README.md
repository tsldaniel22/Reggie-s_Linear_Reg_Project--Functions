Hi all! This project tested my understanding of functions and nested loops through a hypothetical scenario. 
In the project, Reggie, a scientist, is working on researching the bounciness of different balls so as to optimize the pit. He is running an experiment to bounce different sizes of bouncy balls, and then fitting lines to the data points he records.
My task was to create a function that could produce the best-fit line with a given set of data, where the equation of the line is as given : y = mx + b.
